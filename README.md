# TF2serverManager
Powershell Script to manage your TF2 server (update the game, workshop management and Windows utilities)

Do not launch without editing the pathes in the script, else it will not work. Maybe i will bother myself to make a path configurer later (maybe)

Do not launch without allowing powershell script, else it will return an error.

I will not take any responsabilities to any damaged cause by my script (or bad use of it), only use it if you know what your doing and if you checked my code (i'm not profesionnal, i'm more of a network manager than a dev so i have bad habits)

Update log:
V2: added some stuff including separate 64 and 32 bits launch options (I updated it as i used it, I will try to do a better log next time i promise)

PS:
V3 might be QOS like the path setup.
